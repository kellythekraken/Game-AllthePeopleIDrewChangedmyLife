//talking about being hit on by cis men
B: No matter how androgynous I dress, I still get hit on by cis men all the time
B: It is very frustrating, my feature doesn't signal any invitation or permission to those men.

<<elseif visited_count("GroupConversation") == 1>>
//talking about straight passing at queer space
A: When I'm in queer spaces I'm always perceived as the 'ally'.
A: Just because I dress feminine? 
B: It can be especially dishartening to not be recognized by people from the queer community.
B: But at the end of the day, why should one's outfit reflect on how valid they are as a queer person?

<<elseif visited_count("GroupConversation") == 2>>
//talking about looking queer
B: Why do you think some queer people choose not to look queer?
B: I heard that the older people get, the more comfortable they are with looking queer.
C: There are many factors considered. It may not be the safest option to be out of the closet, 
C: especially if the young are dependent on the adult they live with.
A: It's not a style that suits everyone, I guess. If I feel very comfortable with myself, why should I change?

<<elseif visited_count("GroupConversation") == 3>>
//talking about being perceived as woman
C: Many cis people are shocked when I come out to them as non-binary.
C: They think, why do you have long hair? Why do you wear pink and pastel? 
C: How can you be non-binary without looking androgynous?
C: Just because I dress more feminine, most people automatically assume my gender identity and pronouns.
C: Why can't I just be outside of the box?

Have you tried their new cocktail 'fruit salad'? 
Although my favorite remain to be 'unicorn sunset'. 
Who doesn't want to drink pretty glitters?
