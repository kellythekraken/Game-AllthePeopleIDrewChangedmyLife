    Ali: Enjoying the night?
    Ali: Haven’t seen you around before. I’m Ali. 
    Ali: My salon is down the road. So I come here pretty often. 
//    Ali: But I bet my hair also helped a lot with that. It may strike as unusual, but in queer places you don’t stand out as much. 
//    Ali: Not complaining at all! I love seeing people with different, colourful hair. 
    Ali: Saw you sketching earlier. You an artist?
    Ali: 
//    Ali: Ah awesome. I’ve encountered queer artists here and there.
    Ali: You want to sketch me? 
    Ali: Oh, of course, would be my honour.

        Ali: We were discussing about the benefit of having colorful hair.
        Ali: Once I met this person who used their blue hair to help people memorize her in a networking event.
        Ali: Even outside of queer space, seeing people embracing their queerness with crazy hair always put a smile on my face.
        Ali: Artists and queer kids, the two groups with the highest concentration of colorful hair. 
    <<elseif $AliChat == 2>>
        Ali: Have you ever dyed your hair?
        Ali: I know a person who come here often, they are specialized in hairdyes, especially on shaved heads.
        Ali: Will give you a shout know if I spot them tonight!
    <<elseif $AliChat == 3>>
        Ali: Was talking with my friends about your drawing. 
        Ali: One suggested you should use it as an icebreaker, getting to know people a bit.
        Ali: Even flirt a bit, maybe.

    Ali: Once talked to a client who’s a life model. You know, posing for life drawings? It’s quite fascinating. 
<<elseif $Stroke == 2>>
    Ali: What's in your mind when you’re drawing your subject?
    Ali: When I give haircuts, I usually talk to my client. Getting to know who they are, why they want that hairstyle…
    Ali: Then I have a better understanding of what represents them the best, and how they want to be seen.
<<elseif $Stroke == 3>>
    Ali: Is it the same for you? Studying a person's features closely. Isn’t that quite personal and intimate? 
    Ali: The only thing is that you’re not drawing directly on your subject and altering their look. Like haircuts, or tattoos.
<<elseif $Stroke == 4>>
    Ali: I don't see myself fitting in the binary anymore. 
    Ali: But I'm comfortable for presenting myself feminine sometimes. So I use she/they pronouns.
    <<pronoun>>
    Ali: It shouldn't be so black and white, anyways.
<<elseif $Stroke == 5>>
    Ali: The first time I shaved my head I felt so liberated. 
    Ali: I always wanted to do that but never had the need, or reason to. 
    Ali: Until we had this game, and someone dared me to shave it all off.
    Ali: I did. And I looked at myself in the mirror. It was someone new, someone different. 
    Ali: Someone hiding inside of me that wanted to be seen for a long time.
<<elseif $Stroke == 6>>
    Ali: For me it's a form of rebellion.
    Ali: I felt brave for looking different. 
    Ali: The best thing about it? I am acting myself this time. For once I could abandon the fear of not fitting in. I was comfortable in my skin.
    Ali: People started to recognizing me as queer. And especially queer people, too.
    Ali: I felt so visible. I never looked back.
<<elseif $Stroke == 7>>
    Ali: There’s a reason why hair is so important for many queer folks.
    Ali: It’s very fulfilling to be in a hair space, where queer visibility is fostered to flourish.
    Ali: It's always delightful to see people leave with a look that they relate themselves more than the one they came in with. 
<<elseif $Stroke == 8>>
    Ali: But on a negative note, I was quite obsessed with altering my look to be more queer. 
    Ali: I thought I'm not queer enough for a long time.
    Ali: But I tell you, looking queer is a scam! 
    Ali: Pretty sure everyone felt that way. 
    Ali: With so much assumptions around 'straight-passing', even within our community.
<<elseif $Stroke == 9>>
    Ali: There's no rulebook of what queerness look like.
    Ali: By defining a queer look, you’re putting yourself into box again!
    Ali: Whatever hairstyle, long or short, common or offbeat, if you wear that, then it is a queer style.

    Ali: I'd love to invite you to pop by my salon one day, to continue this conversation.
