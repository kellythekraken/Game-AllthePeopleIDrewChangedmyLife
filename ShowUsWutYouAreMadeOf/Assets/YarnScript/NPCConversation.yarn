    Ali: Hey!
    Ali: Enjoying the night?
    Ali: Haven’t seen you around before. I’m Ali. 
    Ali: Saw you sketching earlier. Are you an artist?
    Ali: Had the luck to be drawn by one queer illustrator a few weeks ago. 
    Ali: It's intriguing to see yourself on a flat piece of paper, not quite like photos.
    Ali: Afterall, I was being carefully watched for a period of time.
    Ali: I thought, so that's how they see me.
    Ali: ...
    //isn't that queer gaze at its finest?
    Ali: You would like to sketch me? 
    Ali: Oh, that would be my honour.

        Ali: Hey! Thank you for the drawing earlier.
        Ali: We were discussing about the benefit of colorful hair.
        Ali: Once met this person who used her blue hair as a strategy, so people remember her in networking events.
    <<elseif $AliChat == 1>>
        Ali: Even outside of queer space, seeing people embracing their queerness with crazy hair always put a smile on my face.
        Ali: I think lilac might look good on you.
        Ali: We got a hairdye specialist who comes here often. Will give you a shout if I spot them tonight!
    <<elseif $AliChat == 2>>
        Ali: Was talking with my friends about your drawing. 
        Ali: It's a way to break the ice, getting to know people a bit.
        Ali: Even flirt a bit, maybe.
        Ali: Coming from one of their suggestions.

    Ali: Once talked to a client who’s a life model. You know, posing for life drawings? It’s quite fascinating. 
<<elseif $Stroke == 1>>
    Ali: What's in your mind when you’re drawing your subject?
    Ali: I work in a salon. Usually I talk to my client when I'm giving haircuts. 
    Ali: Getting to know who they are, why they want that hairstyle…
    Ali: Then I have a better understanding of what represents them the best, and how they want to be seen.
<<elseif $Stroke == 2>>
    Ali: Studying a person's features closely. Isn’t that quite personal and intimate? 
    Ali: Except unlike haircuts or tattoos, you’re not changing or altering their look. 
<<elseif $Stroke == 3>>
    Ali: The first time I shaved my head I felt so liberated. 
    Ali: I always wanted to do that but never had the need, or reason to. 
    Ali: Until we had this occassion, where someone dared me to shave it all off.
    Ali: I did. And I looked at myself in the mirror. It was someone new, someone different. 
    Ali: Someone hiding inside of me that wanted to be seen for a long time.
<<elseif $Stroke == 4>>
    Ali: I don't see myself fitting in the binary anymore. 
    Ali: But I'm comfortable presenting the feminine side of me. So currently I define myself as she/they the most.
    <<pronoun>>
    Ali: It shouldn't be black or white anyways.
<<elseif $Stroke == 5>>
    Ali: I felt brave for looking different. 
    Ali: Gender and style expressions. For me it's all a form of rebellion.
    Ali: But not only that, I am acting myself this time. For once I could abandon the fear of not fitting in. I was comfortable in my skin.
    Ali: People started to recognizing me as queer. And especially queer people, too.
    Ali: I felt so visible. I never looked back.
<<elseif $Stroke == 6>>
    Ali: Finding a community also helps. 
    Ali: No matter how different you are with people out there. Knowing there're people sharing similar experiences and stories with you. 
    Ali: It eases that feeling of isolation.
<<elseif $Stroke == 7>>
    Ali: There’s a reason why hair is so important for many queer folks.
    Ali: It’s very fulfilling to be in a hair space, where queer visibility is fostered to flourish.
    Ali: It's always delightful to see people leave with a look that they relate themselves more than the one they came in with. 
<<elseif $Stroke == 8>>
    Ali: But on a negative note, I did fall into the trap of altering myself to look more queer. 
    Ali: I thought I'm not queer enough for the longest time.
    Ali: But I tell you, looking queer is a scam! 
    Ali: Pretty sure everyone felt that way. 
    //Ali: With so much assumptions around 'straight-passing', even within our community.
<<elseif $Stroke == 9>>
    Ali: There's no rulebook of what queerness look like.
    Ali: By defining a queer look, you’re putting yourself into box again!
    Ali: Whatever hairstyle, long or short, common or offbeat, if you wear that, then it is a queer style.

    Ali: I'd love to invite you to pop by my salon one day, to continue this conversation.
